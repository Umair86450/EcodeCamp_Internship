# Image Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

## Overview

Welcome to the Image Classification project using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)! This project aims to develop a robust image classification model that categorizes images into different classes using advanced machine learning techniques. The model leverages CNNs to achieve high accuracy in classifying images from datasets such as CIFAR-10 or MNIST.

## Objectives

- **Data Collection:** Use labeled image datasets to train the model.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Prepare images for training by resizing, normalizing, and augmenting them.
- **Model Building:** Design and train a CNN model to classify images.
- **Deployment:** Deploy the model and create a user-friendly web interface for real-time classification.

## Task Roadmap
